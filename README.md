<h1>What is it?</h1>

Slove is an easy way to share love with people you care about. 

How it works:<br/>
1. Download Slove and create an account in a few seconds.<br/>
2. Check which friends are already on Slove or invite people you want to send a Slove to.<br/>
3. When feeling grateful, when feeling happy, when feeling the need to express good vibes, send a slove to the person you care about.<br/>
4. You have a limited amount of Sloves per day, use it/them wisely.<br/>

<h1>How do I get it?</h1>

Slove is currently available on the App Store following <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/app/slove/id1023675203?mt=8>this link</a>.

<h1>Who are you?</h1>

We are a team of 4 french people: 1 back-end developer, 1 front-end developer, 1 designer and 1 other guy.

<h1>Why do you share this code?</h1>

Because this project is now stopped. And because I still trust in it a lot, I'd prefer that someone take it over rather than it becomes forgotten and wasted forever.

<h1>Why did you stop it?</h1>

The main reason is because Slove is based on a Facebook technology called "Parse". Facebook recently announced that Parse will shut down on January 2017. Which means that our back-end developer needs to start again from scratch if we want to keep on working.<br/>
